# The Swift Summary Book
A summary of Apple's Swift language written on Playgrounds.

### Why this summary?
Apple's documentation is great for learning Swift, but who's got the time to read all that? :smile:

This summary cuts to the chase. It is directly written on the Playgrounds platform, which makes it very interactive.
You can tinker around with it as much as you like!

## Inside the Box
Once you've downloaded or cloned the repository and you open it with Xcode, you'll find most of the chapters from Apple's documentation, plus a *Resources* folder that contains extra material. The numbering in each chapter is consistent with Apple's. Chapters with a ~~strikethrough~~ have not been added to the book yet as being considered *unimportant*. More specifically, you'll find:

**Chapters**

 01. The Basics
 02. Basic Operators
 03. ~~Strings and Characters~~
 04. Collection Types
 05. Control Flow
 06. Functions
 07. Closures
 08. Enumerations
 09. Classes & Structs
 10. Properties
 11. Methods
 12. Subscripts
 13. Inheritance
 14. Initialization
 15. Deinitialization
 16. ARC
 17. Optional Chaining
 18. Error Handling
 19. Type Casting
 20. ~~Nested Types~~
 21. Extensions
 22. Protocols
 23. Generics
 24. Access Control

**Resources**
- Higher Order Functions

## How should I install this?
Getting started with The Swift Summary Book is a piece of üéÇ:

1. Just clone or download the repository.
2. You need to have Xcode v8.0 or above. You can download it [here](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).
3. Open the `.swift` file with Xcode and *voil√†*!

## What are the features?
The Swift Summary Book takes advantage of the Playground platform and many of its powerful capabilities:
* The book is made of a single file that contains all chapters inside, which allows for easy access.
* Chapters use the Playground Markup Language, which brings rich documentation to the code examples.
* Every chapter has Page Linking, which allows to go back and forth from one chapter to the next, previous or another that was mentioned with in the chapter.


## Keep in mind
The Swift language is still under rapid development, which means that the documentation is changing all the time, and some sections might break at a given time.
