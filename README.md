# The Swift Summary Book
A summary of Apple's Swift language written on Playgrounds.


###Why this summary?
Apple's documentation is great for learning Swift, but who's got the time to read all that? :smile:

This summary cuts to the chase. It is directly written on the Playgrounds platform, which makes it very interactive.
You can tinker around with it as much as you like!


####Keep in mind:exclamation:
The Swift language is still under rapid development, which means that the documentation is changing all the time, and some sections might break at a given time.


####You can help too!
Help me keep this summary :+1: with the latest versions of Swift!
